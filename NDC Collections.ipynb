    "This notebook explores dynamics of the collection items in the NDC. These are the essential items around which all other work will be based. I also found a certain level of inconsistency in the collection items. I found no one single way to reliably retrieve all items that should be classified as \"NDC Collections\" from ScienceBase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original collection items all came from a survey conducted way back at the start of the NGGDPP, which was built as a web form populating survey responses into a Filemaker Pro database built by Jerry McFaul. Rick Brown, who worked up some of the original thinking about the NDC, wrote a process to pull information from that database into what was the Comprehensive Science Catalog (later to be rebuilt as ScienceBase). There are a number of items in the NDC now that have legacy artifacts from that process - NGGDPP Collection extension/facet, unique identifiers (e.g., \"P1323\"). Most of the information that is contained in these older legacy collections is no longer all that relevant and certainly can't be counted on for accuracy. The categorization concepts that were put into the NGGDPP Collection facet seem to have been pulled up into tags from a set of vocabularies, but I don't believe that those terms have been reviewed for some time if at all and cannot really be used in a semantic integration sense. The facet does contain a numeric value that was intended to indicate the relative magnitude of the collections, but I don't believe these have been reviewed for accuracy in a long time either.\n",
    "\n",
    "The identifiers that were assigned to collections way back when the survey was done were created to help keep track of work from that point forward. They were used in the process to identify the collection into which submitted metadata should be organized by placing the identifier on records submitted in spreadsheets or xml files. It may still be useful to keep those IDs on the collection items where relevant, but later collections seem to have dropped this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can somewhat count on the items immediately below the organization collections being the actual NDC Collections and the items I'll be focusing most of my attention on. I created another type classification tag, ndc_collection, that I will likely apply to all of the items deemed to be the actual collections of the NDC. This will make it much more reliable to tease them out of ScienceBase for processing."
