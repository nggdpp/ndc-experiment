# National Digital Catalog - experimental new design
This project explores a new design and concept of operations for the National Digital Catalog of Geological and Geophysical Data (NDC). Major goals of the project include the following:

* Streamline the process of registering and managing NDC collections in ScienceBase
* Allow for more heterogeneity in the information content that can be provided for collections, making everything available for search and discovery but integrating to a small set of high-level attributes
* Explore the possibility of new methods for registering underlying collections from State Geological Surveys and USGS organizations to provide richer information to the NDC with lower burden on contributors
* Produce an integratable suite of data indexes in a cloud-based search infrastructure
* Product an API that provides search, discovery, and maintenance tools across the integrated indexes
* Remove unnecessary and confusing "sample-level" items from ScienceBase
* Demonstrate the utility of the integrated index through presentations, video walkthroughs, and one or more working user interfaces

## Installing packages for the NDC Data Processing Exploration.ipynb notebook
Your Jupyter notebook environment might be missing some of the packages required for this notebook that are not in the conda libraries. Here are commands to install folium and gis_metadata (not available through conda). At the command prompt, activate the python environment where you will run the notebook. Then
>pip install gis-metadata-parser
>conda install -c conda-forge folium
